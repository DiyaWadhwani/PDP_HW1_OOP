CREATIVE ADDITION

My creative addition is that I am including User Inputs to function this code, where nothing is hardcoded and the program runs the way the user wishes.
On running the code, the user can choose from a menu of options whether they would like to add a new interaction, remove an existing one, view all the existing interactions or exit the program. If a user wishes to add a new interaction, they also have the option of choosing what type of interaction they would like to add - Chat GPT or Dalle Interaction type.
When a user wishes to remove an interaction, they can pick which one they want to remove from an existing list of interactions, given that there exists a list.

STEPS TO RUN THE CODE

Enter 'node main.js' in your terminal and do as you please :D
PS - Remember to enter your choice as '4' to stop running the program!!
